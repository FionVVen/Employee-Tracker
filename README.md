# Employee-Tracker

## Description
Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. This application allows you to add, update and delete departments, roles, employees. You can also update employee managers, view employees by manager and view the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department.

The application uses the inquirer package, and will be invoked by using the following command:
node server.js
